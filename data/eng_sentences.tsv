1276	eng	Let's try something.
1277	eng	I have to go to sleep.
1280	eng	Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
1282	eng	Muiriel is 20 now.
1283	eng	The password is "Muiriel".
1284	eng	I will be back soon.
1286	eng	I'm at a loss for words.
1287	eng	This is never going to end.
1288	eng	I just don't know what to say.
1289	eng	That was an evil bunny.
1290	eng	I was in the mountains.
1291	eng	Is it a recent picture?
1292	eng	I don't know if I have the time.
1294	eng	Education in this world disappoints me.
1295	eng	You're in better shape than I am.
1296	eng	You are in my way.
1298	eng	This will cost €30.
1299	eng	I make €100 a day.
1300	eng	I may give up soon and just nap instead.
1301	eng	It's because you don't want to be alone.
1302	eng	That won't happen.
1303	eng	Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
1304	eng	I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
1305	eng	I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
1306	eng	I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
1308	eng	I miss you.
1309	eng	I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
1310	eng	I always liked mysterious characters more.
1311	eng	You should sleep.
1312	eng	I'm going to go.
1313	eng	I told them to send me another ticket.
1314	eng	You're so impatient with me.
1315	eng	I can't live that kind of life.
1316	eng	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
1317	eng	I never liked biology.
1318	eng	The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
1319	eng	If the world weren't in the shape it is now, I could trust anyone.
1320	eng	It is unfortunately true.
1321	eng	They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.
1322	eng	Most people think I'm crazy.
1323	eng	No I'm not; you are!
1324	eng	That's MY line!
1325	eng	He's kicking me!
1326	eng	Are you sure?
1327	eng	Then there is a problem...
1328	eng	Oh, there's a butterfly!
1329	eng	Hurry up.
1330	eng	It doesn't surprise me.
1332	eng	For some reason I feel more alive at night.
1333	eng	It depends on the context.
1334	eng	Are you freaking kidding me?!
1335	eng	That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
1336	eng	I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
1337	eng	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
1338	eng	America is a lovely place to be, if you are here to earn money.
1339	eng	I'm so fat.
1340	eng	So what?
1341	eng	I'm gonna shoot him.
1342	eng	I'm not a real fish, I'm just a mere plushy.
1343	eng	I'm just saying!
1344	eng	That was probably what influenced their decision.
1345	eng	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
1346	eng	This is what I would have said.
1347	eng	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
1348	eng	That's because you're a girl.
1349	eng	Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
1350	eng	It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.
1351	eng	It would be something I'd have to program.
1352	eng	I don't intend to be selfish.
1353	eng	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
1354	eng	How many close friends do you have?
1355	eng	I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
1356	eng	This is always the way it has been.
1357	eng	I think it is best not to be impolite.
1358	eng	One can always find time.
1359	eng	I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
1360	eng	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
1361	eng	When I woke up, I was sad.
1362	eng	That is somewhat explained at the end.
1363	eng	I thought you liked to learn new things.
1364	eng	Most people write about their daily life.
1365	eng	If I could send you a marshmallow, Trang, I would.
1366	eng	In order to do that, you have to take risks.
1367	eng	Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.
1368	eng	Why do you ask?
1369	eng	I am not an artist. I never had the knack for it.
1370	eng	I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
1371	eng	I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.
1372	eng	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
1373	eng	How long did you stay?
1374	eng	Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
1375	eng	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
1376	eng	Humans were never meant to live forever.
1377	eng	I don't want to lose my ideas, even though some of them are a bit extreme.
1378	eng	I think I have a theory about that.
1379	eng	That is intriguing.
1380	eng	You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
1381	eng	I do not have an account in these forums.
1382	eng	If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
1383	eng	I didn't know where it came from.
1384	eng	I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
1385	eng	This is not important.
1386	eng	I didn't like it.
1387	eng	She's asking how that's possible.
1388	eng	You're just running away from life's problems.
1389	eng	If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
1390	eng	There's a problem there that you don't see.
1391	eng	You can do it.
1392	eng	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
1393	eng	I wish I could go to Japan.
1394	eng	I hate it when there are a lot of people.
1395	eng	I have to go to bed.
1396	eng	After that, I left, but then I realized that I forgot my backpack at their house.
1397	eng	I won't ask you anything else today.
1398	eng	It may freeze next week.
1399	eng	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
1400	eng	The police will get you to find the bullets.
1401	eng	Thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot.
1402	eng	That wasn't my intention.
1403	eng	Thanks for your explanation.
1404	eng	Theoretically, I'm doing math.
1406	eng	If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
1407	eng	It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
1408	eng	I don't know what you mean.
1409	eng	My computer has got to be useful for something.
1410	eng	You wanted to tell me about freedom?
1411	eng	Uh, now it's really weird...
1412	eng	If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
1413	eng	One can't expect everything from schools.
1414	eng	There are many words that I don't understand.
1415	eng	I don't like it when mathematicians who know much more than I do can't express themselves explicitly.
1416	eng	You're really not stupid.
1417	eng	I need to ask you a silly question.
1418	eng	I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
1419	eng	I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
1420	eng	Can it be phrased in another way?
1421	eng	No one will know.
1422	eng	I found a solution, but I found it so fast that it can't be the right solution.
1423	eng	It seems interesting to me.
1424	eng	Except that here, it's not so simple.
1425	eng	I like candlelight.
1426	eng	What did you answer?
1427	eng	No, he's not my new boyfriend.
1428	eng	It's too bad that I don't need to lose weight.
1429	eng	You never have class or what?!
1430	eng	I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
1431	eng	Where is the problem?
1432	eng	I can only wait.
1433	eng	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
1434	eng	I love you.
1435	eng	I don't like you anymore.
1436	eng	I am curious.
1437	eng	Congratulations!
1438	eng	I don't want to wait that long.
1439	eng	Why don't you come visit us?
1440	eng	But the possibility seems unlikely.
1442	eng	I shouldn't have logged off.
1443	eng	I don't know what to do anymore.
1444	eng	It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
1445	eng	I hate chemistry.
1446	eng	I didn't want this to happen.
1447	eng	You can probably guess what happens though.
1448	eng	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
1449	eng	What other options do I have?
1450	eng	I am not much of a traveller.
1451	eng	I have nothing better to do.
1452	eng	I can't explain it either.
1453	eng	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
1454	eng	Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.
1455	eng	It only shows you're not a robot.
1456	eng	How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
1458	eng	It's not something anyone can do.
1459	eng	I don't know if I still have it.
1460	eng	What do you think I've been doing?
1461	eng	Don't underestimate my power.
1462	eng	My mom doesn't speak English very well.
1463	eng	I don't speak French well enough!
1464	eng	I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
1465	eng	Therein lies the problem.
1466	eng	How do you find food in outer space?
1467	eng	All you can do is trust one another.
1468	eng	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
1469	eng	Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
1470	eng	I utterly despise formal writing!
1471	eng	Foreign people intrigue me.
1472	eng	Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
1473	eng	What keeps you up so late?
1474	eng	You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
1475	eng	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
1476	eng	You're not fast enough.
1477	eng	Life is hard, but I am harder.
1478	eng	Bearing can be unbearable.
1479	eng	Stop it! You're making her feel uncomfortable!
1480	eng	Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
1481	eng	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
1482	eng	I don't speak Japanese.
1483	eng	This is a pun.
1484	eng	Nobody understands me.
1485	eng	I learned to live without her.
1486	eng	It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
1487	eng	I have too many things on my mind these days.
1488	eng	I just wanted to check my email.
1489	eng	Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
1490	eng	You can't expect me to always think of everything!
1491	eng	I suppose that behind each thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
1492	eng	You really don't have the right priorities!
1493	eng	Don't expect others to think for you!
1494	eng	You never have time for important things!
1495	eng	It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
1496	eng	It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
1497	eng	I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
1498	eng	Stop seeing me as a "normal" person!
1499	eng	Are you referring to me?
1500	eng	There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
1501	eng	It can't be!
1502	eng	I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.
1503	eng	"A rolling stone gathers no moss" is a proverb.
1504	eng	Would you like something to drink?
1505	eng	"Who is it?" "It's your mother."
1506	eng	"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
1507	eng	"What's the matter?" asked the little white rabbit.
1508	eng	"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
1509	eng	We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools.
1510	eng	Uh... How's that working?
1511	eng	"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
1512	eng	"Trust me," he said.
1513	eng	"This is what I was looking for!" he exclaimed.
1514	eng	"This looks pretty interesting," Hiroshi says.
1515	eng	Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
1516	eng	"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
1517	eng	"That's very nice of you," Willie answered.
1518	eng	"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
1519	eng	Someday I'll run like the wind.
1520	eng	"She likes music." "So do I."
1521	eng	Please don't cry.
1522	eng	Let me know if there is anything I can do.
1523	eng	It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.
1524	eng	It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
1525	eng	Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
1526	eng	I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
1527	eng	"I feel like playing cards." "So do I."
1528	eng	"Haven't we met somewhere before?" asked the student.
1529	eng	A Japanese would never do such a thing.
1530	eng	Allen is a poet.
1531	eng	The archer killed the deer.
1532	eng	Communism will never be reached in my lifetime.
1533	eng	Rye was called the grain of poverty.
1534	eng	In the 1950's, the Finns were cited as having one of the least healthy diets in the world.
1535	eng	If you see a mistake, then please correct it.
1536	eng	Place the deck of cards on the oaken table.
1537	eng	The Germans are very crafty.
1538	eng	If you don't eat, you die.
1539	eng	How do you spell "pretty"?
1540	eng	Why don't we go home?
1541	eng	I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
1542	eng	Ten years is a long time to wait.
1543	eng	"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
1544	eng	One million people lost their lives in the war.
1547	eng	It is not rare at all to live over ninety years.
1549	eng	First, I'm going to do an outline of my new website.
1550	eng	Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried.
1551	eng	When you're beginning to look like the photo in your passport, you should go on a holiday.
1552	eng	It wasn't me, commissioner!
1553	eng	Oh, my white pants! And they were new.
1554	eng	With so many people around he naturally became a bit nervous.
1555	eng	When I left the train station, I saw a man.
1557	eng	You're an angel!
1558	eng	People from Madrid are weird.
1559	eng	Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
1560	eng	You're lucky because he didn't bite you.
1561	eng	Did you miss me?
1563	eng	Are they all the same?
1564	eng	Thank you very much!
1565	eng	Where are the eggs, please?
1566	eng	I'll take him.
1567	eng	It's a surprise.
1568	eng	That's a good idea!
1569	eng	Round trip? Only one-way.
1570	eng	It's a pity when somebody dies.
1571	eng	They were left speechless.
1572	eng	Damn! It's not bad!
1573	eng	Pull into shape after washing.
1574	eng	Wash before first wearing.
1575	eng	Don't open before the train stops.
1577	eng	Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
1578	eng	They say love is blind.
1579	eng	Oh, I'm sorry.
1580	eng	Math is like love: a simple idea, but it can get complicated.
1581	eng	The only useful answers are those that raise new questions.
1582	eng	To have doubts about oneself is the first sign of intelligence.
1583	eng	Poor is not the one who has too little, but the one who wants too much.
1584	eng	Seeing that you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
1585	eng	How long does it take to get to the station?
1586	eng	This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
1587	eng	Excuse me; allow me to point out three errors in the above article.
1589	eng	It is difficult to keep up a conversation with someone who only says "yes" and "no".
1590	eng	Do you speak Italian?
1591	eng	"I can't think with that noise," she said, as she stared at the typewriter.
1592	eng	It is said that "Hamlet" is the most interesting play ever written.
1594	eng	May I ask a question?
1595	eng	"How do you feel?" he inquired.
1596	eng	It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
1597	eng	It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
1598	eng	I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting it.
1599	eng	It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
1600	eng	I would never have guessed that.
1601	eng	Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
1602	eng	You'll forget about me someday.
1603	eng	That is rather unexpected.
1604	eng	I wonder how long it's going to take.
1605	eng	I can't live without a TV.
1606	eng	I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
1607	eng	Nothing is achieved without effort.
1608	eng	Many people drift through life without a purpose.
1609	eng	Life without love is just totally pointless.
1610	eng	Let me know if I need to make any changes.
1611	eng	I think exams are ruining education.
1612	eng	We can't sleep because of the noise.
1613	eng	Do you have a condom?
1615	eng	Do whatever he tells you.
1616	eng	I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
1617	eng	It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
1618	eng	It is already eleven.
1619	eng	May I talk to Ms. Brown?
1620	eng	"Yes, orange juice please," says Mike.
1621	eng	"Ah!" is an interjection.
1622	eng	What do you want?
1623	eng	The mandatory character of schooling is rarely analyzed in the multitude of works dedicated to the study of the various ways to develop within children the desire to learn.
1624	eng	You suck dude! I have to tell you everything!
1625	eng	I have a bone to pick with you.
1626	eng	Do you need me to give you some money?
1627	eng	Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
1629	eng	Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
1630	eng	I have a dream.
1631	eng	This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
1632	eng	The cost of life increased drastically.
1633	eng	All that which is invented, is true.
1634	eng	To be surprised, to wonder, is to begin to understand.
1635	eng	But the universe is infinite.
1636	eng	To be perfect she lacked just one defect.
1637	eng	And yet, the contrary is always true as well.
1638	eng	We don't see things as they are, but as we are.
1639	eng	The world is a den of crazies.
1640	eng	You opened up my eyes to what it's like when everything is right.
1641	eng	You found me where no one else was looking.
1642	eng	You're by my side; everything's fine now.
1643	eng	What do you mean you don't know?!
1644	eng	You look stupid.
1645	eng	I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
1646	eng	My name is Jack.
1647	eng	I like it very much.
1648	eng	We're meeting up tomorrow?
1649	eng	How do you say that in Italian?
1650	eng	I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
1651	eng	Is it far from here?
1652	eng	These things aren't mine!
1653	eng	Thanks, that's all.
1654	eng	Would you like to dance with me?
1658	eng	Italy is a very beautiful country.
1659	eng	It's not my fault!
1660	eng	I'd like to stay for one night.
1661	eng	Could you dial for me? The telephone is too high.
1662	eng	Is there a youth hostel near here?
1663	eng	Where are the showers?
1664	eng	Open your mouth!
1665	eng	Is it bad?
1666	eng	I have lost my wallet.
1668	eng	Love is never wasted.
1669	eng	Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
1670	eng	Not wanting is the same as having.
1671	eng	He's very sexy.
1673	eng	"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
1674	eng	There are too many things to do!
1676	eng	Come on, play with me, I'm so bored!
1677	eng	Don't you even think of eating my chocolate!
1678	eng	Stop asking me for a drink! Go get it yourself.
1679	eng	Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
1680	eng	I really need to hit somebody.
1681	eng	Who doesn't know this problem?!
1682	eng	It has been so long since I last went to Disneyland with my family.
1683	eng	My parents keep arguing about stupid things. It's so annoying!
1684	eng	If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
1685	eng	My friends always say I'm too calm, but my family always says I'm too annoying.
1686	eng	I hate those spiders. They're always there to freak me out when I'm cleaning.
1687	eng	So annoying... Now I get a headache whenever I use the computer!
1688	eng	It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.
1689	eng	It is very hot today.
1690	eng	Nobody came.
1691	eng	I never saw a red fridge.
1693	eng	Better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you're not.
1694	eng	It's lonely in the saddle since the horse died.
1695	eng	Mathematics is the part of science you could continue to do if you woke up tomorrow and discovered the universe was gone.
1696	eng	My eyes are an ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
1697	eng	You know the phrase, we reap what we sow. I have sown the wind and this is my storm.
1698	eng	Look at me when I talk to you!
1699	eng	What would the world be without women?
1700	eng	What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
1701	eng	I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
1702	eng	This is not my type.
1703	eng	I was trying to kill time.
1704	eng	How did you come up with this crazy idea?
1705	eng	I'm tired.

2137	eng	If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
2138	eng	The essence of liberty is mathematics.
2139	eng	His story was too ridiculous for anyone to believe.
2140	eng	How many hours of sleep do you need?
2141	eng	Each person is a world.
2142	eng	I have French nationality but Vietnamese origins.
2143	eng	It's very frustrating to try to find your glasses when you can't see anything without glasses.
2144	eng	Do you think mankind will someday colonize the Moon?
2145	eng	What famous songs do you wish you had composed, and why?
2146	eng	I'm going to buy myself a new camera, digital this time.
2147	eng	I'm crazy about you.
2148	eng	I don't know what is worse.
2149	eng	Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal.
2150	eng	I am proud to be a part of this project.
2151	eng	Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
2152	eng	Who buys this type of art?

2160	eng	I created a shortcut on the desktop.
2161	eng	I want an MP3 player!
2162	eng	My brother is very important. At least he thinks he is.
2163	eng	While eating a pizza he was annoying his sister.
2164	eng	At this rate, we're not likely to be done before the end of the week.
2165	eng	I guess my view on friendship is pretty bleak because I've never really had to rely on anyone for anything.

2167	eng	No, I cannot let you in, there's one person too many.
2168	eng	Where are you?

2383	eng	Why aren't you coming with us?
2384	eng	I can't say the opposite.
2385	eng	Why are you telling me about hippos all of the sudden? I don't see the connection between that and your twelve red goldfishes.

2463	eng	Who said that? It's totally wrong!
2464	eng	When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
2465	eng	Wolves won't usually attack people.

6133	eng	I can't believe my eyes.
6135	eng	I couldn't say when exactly in my life it occurred to me that I would be a pilot someday.
6136	eng	An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
6138	eng	She has always done her best to make their life easier.
6140	eng	I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.

12621	eng	Just a minute.
13034	eng	You asked after her? What did she say?

15835	eng	You need only ask him to pay the debt.
15836	eng	You told him that he should have a reward.
15837	eng	I don't think you can gain his ear.
15838	eng	You ought to thank him.
15839	eng	You have only to give him a little help.
